# Hello-World
I'm new to all this and struggling and would love any help. I had a mild brain injury several years ago and that is adding to my struggle. 
My main issue right now is that I have had a new Ender 3 pro for about a month and have added the following upgrades, duel z axis with two stepper motors, btt skr mini e3 v2.0 & tft35 e3 v3.0, btt smart filament sensor.
I'm running into a road block as I purchased a abl bed leveling sensor kit from Aliexpress, which I found out is a clone of the one from Uptanium. However I'm having issues with getting it to work. 
My other issue is I'm totally lost in trying to configure and flash Marlin 2.0 onto my printer. I found the latest btt skr mini e3 v2.0 marlin files here on github, however the config file was empty. I fugured out thanks to Teaching Tech on YouTube how to replace these files for my printer. 
But now what do I do once I have them. I have Notepad++ installed and can open the config_h, and config_adv folders. How do I list the correct motherboard, printer, then settings for bed leveling. 
I'm really struggling. About ready to scrap it all since my frustration level isn't that great. I've had a blast so far with the printer. But now that its time to start getting into the nuts and bolts i'm hitting a wall. 
So as I said, any help wold be greatly appriciated. Many thanks in advance..
